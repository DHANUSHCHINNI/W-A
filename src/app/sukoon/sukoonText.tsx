        <b>From hustle to husshhh. Sukoon, delivered.</b><br />
        A monthly subscription for emotional well-being — where art, reflection, and community come together to help you pause, feel, and reconnect. Instead of one-off sessions, Sukoon offers a steady rhythm of care through live, creative gatherings.

        <b>Why a Subscription?</b><br />
        Because care needs consistency.<br />
        Sukoon gives you:
        <ul>
            A monthly rhythm for emotional check-ins
            Live, arts-based sessions and community events
            Support that grows with you, not just during crisis
        </ul>
    </p>,
    <p key="3">
        <b>Why Creativity?</b><br />
        Because creativity is the gym for your emotional health. It regulates. It reconnects. It gives shape to what words often can't.<br />
        Here, art isn't extra — it's the core. From it grows clarity, calm, and connection.

        <ul>
            If you're feeling overwhelmed or just need space <br />
            If you're waiting for the right therapist — this is a meaningful meanwhile <br />
            If you're in therapy, Sukoon complements and deepens the process <br />
            If you've completed therapy, it helps you stay connected to yourself <br />
