        The Therapy Hub offers a safe and supportive environment for personal and collective exploration. We provide individual and group therapy services (Check out Raahat), as well as supervision for professionals.

        At the Well-being & Arts Hub, therapy is not a service — it's a relationship.<br />
        Rooted in arts-based, trauma-informed, and culturally aware approaches, our Therapy Hub offers modular, flexible options for those seeking support that honours both personal depth and collective realities.<br />
        Whether you're looking for individual therapy, group spaces, or professional supervision, our offerings grow with you.
