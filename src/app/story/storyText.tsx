    <p key="3">From late-night walks in London to community circles in India, our story begins with a return —To rhythm. To roots. To each other.</p>,
    <p key="4">We were therapists in the UK, working across NHS wards and grassroots spaces — Our friendship grew through shared work, big questions, and even bigger laughter. In that space of trust, a vision and a dream began to form.</p>,
    <p key="5">One of our earliest collaborations was <b>Project Bhava </b> — an immersive, multidisciplinary performance series in Brighton, UK. Through <b>nine evocative performances </b>, we explored the spectrum of human emotion, inspired by the Indian aesthetic of Navarasas. Rasa by rasa, we sparked dialogue, built connection, and watched strangers come alive through shared feeling.</p>

    <p key="6"><b> We dreamt of changing the landscape of mental health in India </b> — Not just for those seeking support, but for those offering it.</p>,
    <p key="7">We wanted to transform how care is held, how therapy is taught, and how mental health is imagined altogether.</p>,
    <p key="8">It was a dream rooted in justice, joy, and imagination. A dream where arts are not an add-on, but a form of medicine—  a part of a global movement recognising the role of creative expression in healthcare and human flourishing.</p>

    <p key="2">That dream became the <b>Well-being & Arts Hub</b> — A living, breathing space for creative connection.</p>,
    <p key="3">We are artists, therapists, listeners, wanderers. We hold spaces where the personal meets the political, and the playful meets the profound. We're building a modular ecosystem of creative care.</p>,
    <p key="4">Not just for individuals, but for workplaces, communities, and the world.</p>,
    <p key="5">Whether you're a seeker, a professional, a wanderer, or simply someone who feels — You're welcome here.</p>,
    <p key="6">Because care, like art, was never meant to be solitary.</p>

        Amruta Huddar doesn’t just work with the body—she listens to it. In every tremor, gesture, or pause, she sees a story waiting to be honoured. A trained Bharatanatyam and Odissi dancer, her earliest language was movement. Long before therapy rooms and academic accolades, it was the stage where she first learned how bodies hold memory, resistance, and power.
    </p>,
    <p key="2">
        But Amruta’s most radical training has been her own life.<br />
        With a lived reality of stammering, she has navigated a world that prizes fluency over authenticity, and has learned to challenge the invisibility of certain disabilities. Today, she’s not just a UK HCPC-licensed Drama and Movement Psychotherapist—she’s a researcher, a published author, and a powerful advocate for disability justice. Her work makes space for the parts of us that often go unseen.
    </p>,
    <p key="3">
        Across 8+ years in the mental health field, Amruta has worked in India and the UK, walking alongside those living with trauma, addiction, and eating disorders. As part of Project Udaan—a pioneering mental health initiative between Tata Trusts and the Government of Maharashtra—Amruta led the integration of creative arts into psychiatric rehabilitation, transforming the Nagpur Regional Mental Hospital into a contemporary, arts-based therapeutic environment. Her work pioneered the use of arts as a rehabilitative tool for service users in a system that had long relied solely on conventional methods. She also contributed to the District Mental Health Programme, where she facilitated embodied practices and capacity-building for frontline workers as part of systemic mental health reform.
    </p>,
    <p key="4">
        As co-founder of Well-being & Arts Hub, she designs bold, arts-led spaces that don’t just soothe—but provoke, stretch, and connect. She creates vibrant, arts-led spaces that challenge norms and invite people back to their bodies, their histories, and their wholeness. Her mission is not just to integrate Indian philosophies and classical arts into modern therapy—it’s to remind us that well-being doesn’t have to whisper. It can dance. It can roar.<br />
        If you’ve ever felt like your story didn’t fit the script, you’ll find something sacred in the way Amruta holds space: tender, true, and radically inclusive.

    <p key="1">Kritija Saxena knows how to hold complexity. As a Drama & Movement Psychotherapist, Psychologist, and lifelong Kuchipudi dancer, she works at the powerful intersection of art, identity, and psychological depth.
        <br />
        Her specialty lies in working with complex trauma, especially in contexts where pain and power collide. She was the first Arts Psychotherapist appointed by East London NHS Foundation Trust’s Women’s Forensic Services, where she worked with survivors of severe sexual trauma and individuals navigating extreme behavioural and relational challenges. Her clinical insight is matched by her fierce compassion—and a steady hand in the most volatile therapeutic terrains.
    </p>,
    <p key="2"> Over the past 10+ years, Kritija has led creative mental health interventions across India and the UK—from co-developing programs for at-risk youth in Tamil Nadu, to designing and delivering leadership training programmes for NHS staff in East London. She is a certified Queer Affirmative Counsellor and is passionate about workplace mental health policies.</p>,
    <p key="3">At Well-being & Arts Hub, she brings all of this experience into play—crafting transformational, arts-based spaces where individuals and organisations don’t just cope, they evolve. Her lens is always intersectional, her methods deeply embodied, and her mission clear: to disrupt the status quo, with care and creativity. Her politics are embodied. And her creativity is contagious.
        <br />
        For those who sit in the grey areas—between tradition and rebellion, vulnerability and strength—Kritija is not just a therapist. She is a builder of brave, beautiful new ground.
